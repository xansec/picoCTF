# A collection of tasks that are suitable to bootstrap a web host in a vagrant
# environment. Performs the following key functions (many of which require that
# the shell server has been properly provisioned first):
#
# 1. Adds a pre-generated SSH key that is authorized on the shell server
# 2. Adds any user requested administrative keys
# 3. Configures docker client certificates


# 1. This key is generated in the vagrant_shell_bootstrap.yml playbook and is
# necessary to allow the web server to SSH to the shell server in order to
# "load deployment" and fetch the deployed challenges.
- name: Copy pre-generated SSH key for web user to home directory
  copy:
    src: "{{ pico_base_dir}}/env_dev/keys/{{ ansible_host }}"
    dest: "{{ web_ssh_key }}"
    remote_src: yes

# 2. Adds and keys specified in the admin_keys variable to the host.
- import_tasks: "util_admin_ssh_keys.yml"
  vars:
    admin_user: "{{ ansible_user }}"

# 3. This configures a docker client certificate that was generated in the
# pico-docker role run during the provisioning of the shell server.
- import_role:
    name: pico-docker
    tasks_from: config_user
  vars:
    client: "{{ ansible_host }}"
  when: enable_docker
